# GSharp
An integrated framework that allows you to visually write .NET Framework code.  
This framework enables the development of visual programming solutions.

## Introduction
### [GSharp.Base](GSharp.Base)
It is a core library that can create logic in an objectized form.  
It implements the function of converting objectized logic created into code and managing it.

### [GSharp.Bootstrap](GSharp.Bootstrap)
Provides a running environment of logic designed using the framework.  
It performs additional functions to automatically make the geometry possible in the designed logic.

### [GSharp.Compile](GSharp.Compile)
Performs the compilation of the logic that is designed.  
Automatically detects external references and compiles the final source to generate an executable file.

### [GSharp.Compressor](GSharp.Compressor)
Performs the compression and decompression of the generated executable file.  
Typically used in conjunction with the compilation library to reduce the capacity of an executable file.

### [GSharp.Extension](GSharp.Extension)
Supports the development of modules in the framework.  
Provides the abstract classes and grammatical support required for module development.

### [GSharp.Graphic](GSharp.Graphic)
Provides a graphical control that can be used for block coding.  
Various block and block editor controls are superimposed here.

### [GSharp.Manager](GSharp.Manager)
Supports module management for the framework.  
Enables you to search for and use extension modules.
